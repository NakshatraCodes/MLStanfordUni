### Introduction to Machine Learning

**Arthur Samuels Definition of Machine Learning (1959**

Field of study that gives the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

**Tom Mitchell's Definition of Machine Learning (1998)**

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, measured by P, improves, with experience E.

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

**Some types of Machine Learning Algorithms**
- Supervised Learning *(Teach the computer how to do something)*
- Unsupervised Learning *(Let the computer learn itself)*
Other - Reinforcement Learning. Recommender Systems
